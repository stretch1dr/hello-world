# hello-world
Hi everyone!

I am fairly new at programming, know some languages.
Right now I am learning bash and bash scripting! I enjoy problem-solving.

I like the bash command line

Just started to learn python!
A lot of people seemed confused on which version they should learn
I was told alway learn the newest version!
